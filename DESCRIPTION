Description: A home range is the space an animal uses during a defined period. Home range is assumed to be
	     an asymptotically increasing function of relocation sample size. We know that variation in detection 
	     probability across a landscape can affect the estimated size of a home range, but it's not always
	     obvious whether detection probability is affecting a given estimate. homeRanger provides functions to
	     evaluate the sensitivity of a home range estimate to the removal of individual relocations and to 
	     assess whether a home range estimate is asymptotic.
